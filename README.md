# Automated-Assessment-of-Steam-Plant-Manhole-covers-using a semi-autonomous system
Steam plant manhole covers get heated because of the steam that is constantly flowing through the pipes underneath them.
Issues in underground steam vaults can generate extremely hot manhole covers.
In fact, it is not uncommon for steam plant manhole covers to be hot enough to cause burns.

Addressing the issues from the current process, a new system called - ‘Automatic Steam-plant Infrastructure Thermal-sensing and Reporting system (ASTRS)’, is proposed.

It comprises a thermal camera, Lidar and GPS/IMU interfaced with a computer, that can be mounted on a UMD Facilities vehicle. 

This vehicle can be driven around the specified path in the campus manually and eventually autonomously.

The installed system detects the manhole covers, that come across its path, & records their temperatures & then automatically uploads the data to the GIS server system, with far less human intervention and overhead than existing process.

It uses a combination of sensors to create a system that can automatically detect and locate heated manhole covers more accurately (quality) and efficiently (time, effort, cost) than the current manual method.

This system can help to improve safety by preventing causalities by heated manhole covers, and it can also help to reduce maintenance costs by making it easier to find and repair leaking manhole covers.
